# Cricket-Ball-Trajectory-Estimation-using-Computer-Vision
A computer vision project that detects and tracks a cricket ball in video frames using deep learning. The system reconstructs a smooth 2D trajectory from frame-level detections and visualizes the ball’s flight path for sports analytics and analysis.
